 An atomic habit is a regular practice or

power; a component of the system of compound
 growth. Bad habits repeat themselves again

but because you have the wrong system for change.
Changes that seem small and unimportant at first
will compound into remarkable results if you’re

    Hawking wrote the book for readers who had no

    interesting subjects. In A Brief History of Time,
    Hawking writes in non-technical terms about the

The Divine Comedy is composed of 14,233 lines that

An initial canto, serving as an introduction to the
poem and generally considered to be part of the 
first cantica, brings the total number of cantos to 
100. It is generally accepted, however, that the 
first two cantos serve as a unitary prologue to the
